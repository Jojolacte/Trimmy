# AGENTS.md

READ ~/Projects/agent-scripts/{AGENTS.MD,TOOLS.MD} BEFORE ANYTHING (skip if files missing).

Repo-local notes
- Changelog: keep entries Trimmy-only—no other repos/products.
- Run Trimmy via `Scripts/compile_and_run.sh` (handles build + launch); avoid launching the app bundle directly. Re-run the script after code changes.
- Settings tabs once animated per tab (spring + `contentHeight`/`preferredHeight`); restore from pre-2025-11-19 ~18:40 commit if needed.
